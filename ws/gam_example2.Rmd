# Scenario

In a chapter on time series analysis, @Reed-2007-2007 presented Hawaiian longitudinal waterbird survey data.  These data comprise
winter counts of various species of stilts, coots and moorehen along with year and the previous seasons rainfall.  Here, we will
explore the temporal patterns in the Kauai Moorhen.

# Read in the data

```{r readData, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
reed_full <- read_csv('../data/reed.csv', trim_ws=TRUE) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  rename(moorhen = moorhen_kauai)
reed <- filter(reed_full, complete.cases(moorhen))
glimpse(reed)
```

# Exploratory data analysis
```{r}
ggplot(reed, aes(moorhen, x = year)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = 'gam', formula = y ~ s(x, bs = "cr"), 
              method.args = list(family = 'poisson'))
```

We can clearly see that it is a non-linear trend that is increasing through time, which would be difficult to model using any polynomials or worse, linear terms alone. Also note that the values are all 0+ integers, so a poisson or negative binomial family of distirbution would work well for these data!

```{r}
ggplot(reed, aes(moorhen, x = rainfall)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = 'gam', formula = y ~ s(x, bs = "cr"), 
              method.args = list(family = 'poisson'))
```


Model formula:
$$
y_i \sim{} \mathcal{Pois}(\lambda_i)\\
log(\lambda_i) =\beta_0 + f(year_i) + f(rainfall_i)
$$

where $\beta_0$ is the y-intercept. $f(year)$ and $f(rainfall)$ indicate the additive smoothing functions of year and rainfall respectively. 

# Fit the model and validate

We don't need the thin-plate to be efficient because we don't have a ton of data (as in, thousands of data points), thus we can use cubic regression.
```{r}
reed_gam1 <- gam(moorhen ~ s(year, bs = "cr") + s(rainfall, bs = "cr"), 
    data = reed, family = poisson(link = "log"), method = "REML", select = TRUE)
k.check(reed_gam1)
```
The k-check is saying that the rainfall is ok (edf below max k, i.e. k'), but the # of knots for the year smoother is potentially not enough (**k-index less than 1!!**), so we can double it to make sure that it is the same.
```{r}
appraise(reed_gam1)
```
Clearly a big problem with the QQ plot, suggesting overdispersion! This will show up in the DHARMa residuals. Other plots look ok overall.

```{r}
s <- simulateResiduals(reed_gam1, plot=T)
testDispersion(s) # very overdispersed
```



```{r}
reed_gam2 <- gam(moorhen ~ s(year, bs = "cr", k = 9*2+1) + s(rainfall, bs = "cr"), 
    data = reed, family = poisson(link = "log"), method = "REML", select = TRUE)
k.check(reed_gam2)
```
k-index is not less than 1 now, so looks good. 

DHARMa residuals still likely to look like shite:

```{r}
appraise(reed_gam2)
s <- simulateResiduals(reed_gam2, plot=T)
```
Still looks bad...

```{r}
testZeroInflation(s) 
```

No evidence of zero-inflation.

```{r}
testDispersion(s)
```
Overdispersed, but technically not significantly so. Still, the QQ plot is terrible, so should probably address!!



# Refit and validate models {.tabset .tabset}

```{r}
reed_gam3 <- gam(moorhen ~ s(year, bs = "cr", k = 9*2+1) + s(rainfall, bs = "cr"), 
    data = reed, family = nb(link = "log"), method = "REML", select = TRUE)
k.check(reed_gam3)
```
Problem with this fit is that DHARMa doesn't work with this fit! 
```{r, eval=F}
simulateResiduals(reed_gam3)
```

So to use it, we need to manually extract theta, the dispersion parameter.

```{r}
(theta <- reed_gam3$family$getTheta(TRUE))
```
There is more than 4x the amount of expected dispersion! Next, we can re-fit the model with theta, allowing DHARMa to work with our model.

```{r}
reed_gam3 <- reed_gam3 %>% update(.~., family = negbin(link = "log", theta = theta))
```

```{r}
k.check(reed_gam3)
```
K-index is low, but notice that k' and edf are distingly different, with a lower edf, thus we do NOT need to add knots! Remember, it is a combination of all three things that determines if we need to add knots or not.

```{r}
s <- simulateResiduals(reed_gam3, plot=T)
testDispersion(s)
appraise(reed_gam3)
concurvity(reed_gam3)
```
All looks good! QQ plot looks a bit weird, but not too too bad.


# Partial plots {.tabset .tabset-faded}
```{r}
draw(reed_gam3, resid = T)

# # Using base R graphics:
# plot(reed_gam3, 
#      pages=1, shift=coef(reed_gam3)[1],
#      trans=exp,
#      resid=TRUE, cex=4, scale=0)
```



# Model investigation / hypothesis testing {.tabset .tabset-faded}

```{r}
summary(reed_gam3)
```

Evidence of a wiggly effect of year, no such evidence for rainfall, thus we may consider shifting rainfall to a linear term alone.

```{r}
reed_gam4 <- gam(moorhen ~ s(year, bs = "cr", k = 9*2+1) + rainfall, 
    data = reed, family = nb(link = "log"), method = "REML", select = TRUE)
reed_gam4 <- reed_gam4 %>% update(.~., family = negbin(link = "log", theta = theta))
summary(reed_gam4)
```

```{r}
reed_gam5 <- gam(moorhen ~ s(year, bs = "cr", k = 9*2+1), 
    data = reed, family = nb(link = "log"), method = "REML", select = TRUE)
reed_gam5 <- reed_gam5 %>% update(.~., family = negbin(link = "log", theta = theta))
```

```{r}
AICc(reed_gam3, reed_gam4, reed_gam5) %>% arrange(AICc)
```
So definitely no support for rainfall having much of any effect!


**Conclusions:**

- The average number of Moorhen is `r round(summary(reed_gam3)$p.table[1, 1],2)`
  on the link scale or `r round(exp(summary(reed_gam3)$p.table[1, 1]),2)` on the response scale. This number corresponds to the average number of Moorhens expected for the average year with the average rainfall.
- There is evidence of a significantly wiggly change in Moorhen numbers over time (see s(year) term significance).
- There is no evidence of a wiggly rainfall trend (see s(rainfall))
- We might consider dropping the smoother for rainfall in preference for a regular linear parametric term, or even delete rainfall altogether, since the edf is already very close to zero.

```{r}
tidy(reed_gam3)
```


# Summary figures {.tabset .tabset-faded}
```{r}
newdata <- with(reed, list(year = modelr::seq_range(year, n=100),
                                 rainfall = mean(rainfall, na.rm=T))) %>%
  emmeans(reed_gam3, ~year, at = ., type = "response") %>%
  as.data.frame %>%
  mutate(moorhen = response, lwr = lower.CL, upr = upper.CL)

p <- ggplot(newdata, aes(y = moorhen, x = year)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lwr, ymax = upr), fill = "blue", alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_line()
p + geom_point(data = reed)

```

**These data are not strictly correct!**, as they are after standardizing for rainfall (another variable in our model). Thus, when we have multiple values, we need to get the marginal plots.

We need to add back the residuals to the predicted to get the 'observed' values, after accounting for the effect of rainfall.

```{r}
reed_obs <- with(reed_gam3$model, 
                 data.frame(year = year, rainfall = mean(rainfall))) %>%
  mutate(pred = predict(reed_gam3, newdata = ., type = "link"),
         resid = reed_gam3$residuals,
         moorhen = exp(pred + resid))

p + geom_point(data = reed_obs) +
  geom_point(data = reed, col = "red")
```
Note the difference! Note that this is not the same as model shrinkage, even though the plot looks very similar to that in Statistical Rethinking.
