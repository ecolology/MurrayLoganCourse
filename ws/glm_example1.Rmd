# Scenario

Here is an example from @Fowler-1998-1998. An agriculturalist was interested in the effects of fertilizer load on the yield of grass.  Grass seed was sown uniformly over an area and different quantities of commercial fertilizer were applied to each of ten 1 m<sup>2</sup> randomly located plots.  Two months later the grass from each plot was harvested, dried and weighed.  The data are in the file **fertilizer.csv** in the **data** folder.

![](../resources/turf.jpg){width=70%}

| fert   | yield   |
| ------------ | ------- |
| 25           | 84      |
| 50           | 80      |
| 75           | 90      |
| 100          | 154     |
| 125          | 148     |
| \...         | \...    |

---------------- ---------------------------------------------------
**fert**:  Mass of fertilizer (g.m^-2^) - Predictor variable
**yield**:       Yield of grass (g.m^-2^) - Response variable
---------------- ---------------------------------------------------

 
The aim of the analysis is to investigate the relationship between fertilizer concentration and grass yield.

# Read in the data


```{r readData, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
fert = read_csv('../data/fertilizer.csv', trim_ws=TRUE)
fert <- rename(fert, yield = YIELD, fert = FERTILIZER)
```


```{r examinData}
glimpse(fert)
## Explore the first 6 rows of the data
head(fert)
str(fert)
```

# Exploratory data analysis
```{r}
ggplot(fert, aes(x = fert, y = yield)) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +
    geom_smooth(se=F, col="red") +
    geom_point()
```


Model formula:
$$
y_i \sim{} \mathcal{N}(\mu_i, \sigma^2)\\
\mu_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i
$$

where $y_i$ represents the $i$ observed values, $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$
represent the intercept and slope respectively, and $\sigma^2$ represents the
estimated variance.



```{r EDA, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, hidden=TRUE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(fert, aes(y=yield, x=fert)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
ggplot(fert, aes(y=yield, x=fert)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
ggplot(fert, aes(y=yield)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x=1))
```




# Fit the model





```{r fitModel, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, hidden=TRUE}
fert.lm<-lm(yield~1+fert, data=fert)
fert.lm<-lm(yield~fert, data=fert)
attributes(fert.lm)
names(fert.lm)
```


# Model validation {.tabset .tabset-faded}

Check if our assumptions really are adequate!

```{r}
autoplot(fert.lm, which = 1:6, ncol = 2, label.size = 3)
```

1. Residual plot
Model residuals vs. fitted values/expected values

* No patterns in the points; random scattering
* Watch out for wedge shape, indicating a relationship between mean and variance


2. Quantile-quantile (QQ) plot
Compares your observed values  to what they should look like if from a Gaussian distribution (or depending on the selected distribution)

* Points should follow a 1:1 line
* Often will see that the tails near the beginning or end dip over or under the line, indicating it's not a great fit


3. Scale-location plot

* If we were correcting for autocorrelation, this one should appear random while the residual plot would not
* Otherwise, just looks the same


4. Cook's distance
Determines how influential each point is; calculated by using the residual value and overall leverage on the significant pattern

* Values over 0.8 or 1 is considered 'too' influential
* Look for either an outlier along the x- and/or y-axis

5. Residuals vs. leverage

* Not so useful, but shows if a residual is also high in leverage


6. Cook's distance vs. leverage

* Determines if an influential point is due to high leverage (on its own) or not, based on red boundary


Get the Cook's d values:
```{r}
influence.measures(fert.lm)
```
Leverage is in the hat column


Using `performance` package:
```{r}
require(performance)
performance::check_model(fert.lm, check = c("normality", "homogeneity", "ncv"))
performance::check_outliers(fert.lm)
# Checks for cook's d values and leverage
```

Using `DHARMa` package:
```{r}
require(DHARMa)
fert.resid <- simulateResiduals(fert.lm, plot = T)

```
Left-hand side: QQ plot
* K-S is a test for the distribution fit being significantly different from Gaussian, but is very strict, the test is more robust than this assumption
* Don't have to worry about dispersion for Gaussian
* Outlier test determined by Cook's distance and leverage, but better determined by plotting Cook's distances

Right-hand side: residual plot

* each line is a quantile regression (25%, median, and 75% quantile regressions)
* turn red when heteroscedastic or variance increasing with mean, cause for concern if multiple lines are red
```{r}
testZeroInflation(fert.resid)
```






```{r}
testResiduals(fert.resid)
```











# Model outputs {.tabset .tabset-faded}

Can plot partial plots:

```{r}
fert.lm %>% plot_model(type = "eff", show.data = T)
plot(effects::allEffects(fert.lm, residuals = T))
```

Looks good!

Using package `ggemmeans`:
```{r}
fert.lm %>% ggemmeans(~fert) %>% plot(add.data = T)
```
