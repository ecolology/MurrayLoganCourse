# Scenario

An ecologist studying a rocky shore at Phillip Island, in southeastern Australia, was interested in how
clumps of intertidal mussels are maintained [@Quinn-1988-137]. In particular, he wanted to know how densities of adult
mussels affected recruitment of young individuals from the plankton. As with most marine invertebrates,
recruitment is highly patchy in time, so he expected to find seasonal variation, and the interaction
between season and density - whether effects of adult mussel density vary across seasons - was the aspect
of most interest.

The data were collected from four seasons, and with two densities of adult mussels. The experiment
consisted of clumps of adult mussels attached to the rocks. These clumps were then brought back to the
laboratory, and the number of baby mussels recorded. There were 3-6 replicate clumps for each density
and season combination.

# Read in the data

```{r readData, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
quinn = read_csv('../data/quinn.csv', trim_ws=TRUE) %>%
  janitor::clean_names()
glimpse(quinn)
summary(quinn)
```

Since we intend to model both season and density as categorical variables, 
we need to explicitly declair them as factors.

```{r dataprep, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, hidden=TRUE}
quinn <- quinn %>% janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(season = factor(season, 
                         levels=c('Spring', 'Summer', 
                                  'Autumn', 'Winter')),
         density = factor(density))
```

# Exploratory data analysis

Model formula:
$$
\begin{align}
y_i &\sim{} \mathcal{Pois}(\lambda_i)\\
ln(\mu_i) &= \boldsymbol{\beta} \bf{X_i}\\[1em]
\end{align}
$$
                                           
where $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ is a vector of effects parameters and $\bf{X}$
is a model matrix representing the intercept and effects of season, density and their interaction on mussel recruitment.

```{r eda, hidden=TRUE}
ggplot(quinn, aes(y=recruits, x=season, fill=density)) +
     geom_boxplot()
```

**Conclusions:**

- there is clear evidence of non-homogeneity of variance
- specifically, there is evidence that the variance is related to the mean in
  that boxplots that are lower on the y-axis (low mean) also have lower variance
  (shorter boxplots)
- this might be expected for count data and we might consider that a Poisson
  distribution (which assumes that mean and variance are equal - and thus
  related in a very specific way).

Lets mimic the effect of using a log link, by using log scaled y-axis.

```{r eda1, hidden=TRUE}
ggplot(quinn, aes(y=recruits, x=season, fill=density)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_y_log10()
```

**Conclusions:**

- that is an improvement


# Fit the model {.tabset .tabset-faded}
```{r}
quinn.glmG <- glm(log(recruits + 1) ~ density*season, data = quinn, family = gaussian)
quinn.glm <- glm(recruits ~ density*season, data = quinn, family = poisson(link = 'log'))
```


# Model validation {.tabset .tabset-faded}
```{r}
autoplot(quinn.glm, which = 1:6)
```
Cook's D is off, so although residuals and QQ are fine, there's something wrong with the model
```{r}
quinn.resid <- simulateResiduals(quinn.glm, plot = TRUE)
```
Problem with deviance = More variance than we should expect
Model is overdispersed so the model is not reliable: potential because this si real data and there are more variables that explain recruitment, not just our variables. We can add an 'unit level random effect' to our model = add a variable that makes each variable unique and 'soaks' some of the variance. It will take one DF and shrinks the other estimates, making them less obvious.
Maybe some of the zeros are not actually zeros because the recruits were to small to be counted (zero inflated model).

Can also test for dispersion:
```{r}
testDispersion(quinn.resid) #red line is your supposed actual disperision, the histogram is what it actually should be
performance::check_overdispersion(quinn.glm) #3.309 = 3x more variable that there would normally be
```
Diagnosis = overdispersersion in the model (3x)

```{r}
testZeroInflation(quinn.resid)
performance::check_zeroinflation(quinn.glm) #shows only 2 extra zeros than expected
```
Checking for overdispersion and zero inflation together actually provides a better picture. It showed that the model is overdispersed but it then showed that it's not really zero inflated as 2 zeros are not much.

# Different model {.tabset .tabset-faded}
We'll fit a negative binomial by dividing data into zeros and ones.
```{r}
quinn.nb <- MASS::glm.nb(recruits ~ density*season, data = quinn)
quinn.resid <- simulateResiduals(quinn.nb, plot = TRUE)
```
Compare:
```{r}
AICc(quinn.glm, quinn.nb)
```

# Parial plots {.tabset .tabset-faded}
```{r}
plot_model(quinn.nb, type = 'eff', terms = c('season', 'density'))
```

# Model investigation / hypothesis testing {.tabset .tabset-faded}
```{r}
summary(quinn.nb) #it's on a log-scale

tidy(quinn.nb, conf.int = TRUE, exponentiate = TRUE)
```

N.B. if the model isn't balanced, an ANOVA table will change the outputs depending on the order of the variables

Can use emmeans to do a pairwise to see the effect of each season
```{r}
emmeans(quinn.nb, pairwise ~ density|season, type = 'response')

#on an absolute scale instead of fractional:
emmeans(quinn.nb, ~density|season) %>%
  regrid() %>%
  pairs()

newdata <- emmeans(quinn.nb, ~density|season, type = 'response') %>% 
  as.data.frame()

ggplot(data = newdata, mapping = aes(y = response, x = season, fill = density)) + 
  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = asymp.LCL, ymax = asymp.UCL, 
                      shape = density),
                  position = position_dodge(width = 0.1)) + #so that they don't overlap
  theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        legend.position = c(0.01, 1), legend.justification =  c(0, 1)) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(21, 22))
```

# Summary figures

Fitting a zero inflated model:
```{r zeroinflate, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, hidden=TRUE}
library(pscl)
quinn.zip <- zeroinfl(recruits ~ density*season | 1, data=quinn,  dist='poisson') #the "|1" fits basically a null model
#quinn.resid <- simulateResiduals(quinn.zip,  plot=TRUE) does not support zero inflated models
summary(quinn.zip)
plogis(-3) #approximately 5% of zeros are not real zeros (-3 comes from the zero inflation model coefficients estimate), 5% is a small possibility and it makes sense according to our previous analyses
#tidy(quinn.zip,  conf.int=TRUE, exponentiate = TRUE)
exp(-3.0037)

quinn.zip1 <- zeroinfl(recruits ~ density*season | season, data=quinn,  dist='poisson') #was the rate any different in different seasons? ('|season')
summary(quinn.zip1)
exp(-3.0037)

quinn.zinb <- zeroinfl(recruits ~ density*season | 1, data=quinn,  dist='negbin')
AICc(quinn.zip,  quinn.zinb)

summary(quinn.zinb)
exp(-15.29) #none of them are false zeros because the negative binomial already handled the small amount of zeros
```
